# Movie Collection Prediction Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of predicting the collection (revenue) of movies using machine learning techniques. We'll utilize Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and modeling.

## Step 1: Data Acquisition

The first step is to acquire the dataset containing information about movies. We have two CSV files:
- `Movie_collection_Independent.csv`: Contains independent variables (attributes) of the movies.
- `Movie_collection_Target.csv`: Contains the target variable (collection) of the movies.

We load these CSV files into pandas DataFrames using the `pd.read_csv()` function.

## Step 2: Data Exploration

Once we've loaded the data, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure, features, and distributions. We use methods like `.head()`, `.shape`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` to get an overview of the data.

## Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Before building the predictive model, we preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Step 4: Model Building

We construct a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture consists of an input layer, two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions, and an output layer with a linear activation function. We compile the model using mean squared error as the loss function and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer.

## Step 5: Model Training

We train the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs. During training, we monitor the mean absolute error (MAE) on both the training and validation sets to assess the model's performance.

## Step 6: Model Evaluation

After training, we evaluate the model's performance on the test set using the MAE metric. Additionally, we make predictions on a subset of test records to see how well the model predicts the movie collections.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've demonstrated how to build a neural network model for predicting movie collections based on various attributes. By following these steps, you can apply similar techniques to other predictive modeling tasks in the field of machine learning and data science.
